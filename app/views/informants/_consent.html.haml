%div.consent STUDY TITLE:  Personality on Twitter <br/>
%div.consent PROTOCOL DIRECTOR: Jonathan Adler, Ph.D. <br/>
%div.consent DESCRIPTION: You are invited to participate in a research study on personality on Twitter.  The purpose of the study is to understand how accurately people can read others’ personalities based on their tweets.  You will be asked a short list of questions about the personality of the person who referred you to this study.  Then, you will be asked to complete the same short list of questions about yourself and your personality.  This will enable us to compare the way your friend/family member rated his or her personality with the way you rate it.  (We will also be asking members of our study team to rate your friend/family member’s personality based on his/her Twitter feed.  No one will be rating your personality.)  There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions you will be asked and we will not be assessing anything clinical about you.  Your name and email address, as well as those of the few people who referred you to us, will be kept strictly confidential.  The names and email addresses of all participants (you and your friends/family members) will not be shared with anyone and will be deleted as soon as the study is complete.  We are not affiliated with Twitter in any way and we will not be sending any data or results to Twitter.<br/>
%div.consent RISKS AND BENEFITS:  There are few risks to participation in the study.  The primary risk associated with this study is that it is possible that responding to some questions may make you feel uncomfortable, (e.g., questions about your personality). In addition, there is a minimal risk associated with loss of confidentiality as a result of unforeseen theft or loss of collected data. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any direct benefits from this study.  However, many people enjoy taking personality questionnaires and it might be enjoyable to discuss the study with the friends/family members who referred you to us.  In addition, you will be eligible to win one of three $50 Amazon.com gift certificates that will be randomly given to members of the study group. <br/>
%div.consent TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation in the surveys will likely take no more than 10-15 minutes. <br/>
%div.consent PAYMENTS: As part of participation, you will be eligible to win one of three $50 Amazon.com gift certificates that will be randomly given to members of the study group. <br/>
%div.consent PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand that your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative is not to participate. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions, and to withdraw from the study at any time without adverse consequences. Your individual confidentiality will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study.<br/>
