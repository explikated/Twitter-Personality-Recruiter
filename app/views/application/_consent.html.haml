%consent STUDY TITLE:  Personality on Twitter <br/>
%consent PROTOCOL DIRECTOR: Jonathan Adler, Ph.D. <br/>
%consent DESCRIPTION: You are invited to participate in a research study on personality on Twitter.  The purpose of the study is to understand how accurately people can read others’ personalities based on their Twitter feed.  You will be asked a short list of questions about yourself and your personality.  Then, you will refer us to a few people who know you very well (ideally friends or family members), who will complete the same short personality questionnaire, describing your personality.  Finally, we will copy your tweets from the last 60 days and members of the research team will read your tweets and complete the same short personality questionnaire, describing your personality. This will enable us to compare your personality (as you rate it), with the perceptions of people who know you well and complete strangers reading your Twitter feed.  We can then determine if your Twitter feed clues people in to your personality as accurately as knowing you in person.  There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions you will be asked and we will not be assessing anything clinical about you.  Your name and email address, as well as those of the few people you refer us to, will be kept strictly confidential. Only the text of your tweets will be saved. We will not save any attached photos or your profile picture.   The names and email addresses of all participants (you and your friends/family members) will not be shared with anyone and will be deleted as soon as the study is complete.  We are not affiliated with Twitter in any way and we will not be sending any data or results to Twitter.<br/>
%consent RISKS AND BENEFITS:  There are few risks to participation in the study.  The primary risk associated with this study is that it is possible that responding to some questions may make you feel uncomfortable, (e.g., questions about your personality) or that it may feel uncomfortable to have a friend or family member describing your personality. In addition, there is a minimal risk associated with loss of confidentiality as a result of unforeseen theft or loss of collected data. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any direct benefits from this study.  However, many people enjoy taking personality questionnaires and it might be enjoyable to discuss the study with the friends/family members you refer us to.  In addition, you will be eligible to win one of three $50 Amazon.com gift certificates that will be randomly given to members of the study group. <br/>
%consent TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation in the surveys will take no more than 10-15 minutes. <br/>
%consent PAYMENTS: As part of participation, you will be eligible to win one of three $50 Amazon.com gift certificates that will be randomly given to members of the study group. <br/>

The alternative is not to participate. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions, and to withdraw from the study at any time without adverse consequences. Your individual confidentiality will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study.<br/>
